**Main Research Question**: How to query semantic Material Science Engineering(MSE) data easier than using SPARQL queries? 

**Methodology**: Applying the State-of-Art(SOA) of Visual SPARQL queries to facilitate querying 
semantic MSE data instead of SPARQL queries.

**Evaluation**: Include comparisons with SOA, and use the [SUS questionaries](http://www.measuringu.com/sus.php) 
to assess the usability level. 

Suggestions are always welcome!
